# <br>BIL 573 Term Project - Data Mining Project for BIL573 Course</br><br>Further Investigatian of Football Data Analysis</br> <div align="center"><br>-F.I.F.A-</br></div>

 The goal of this project is to predict match outcomes of European football matches more accurately than bookkeepers, thereby beating the odds and to, in the end, generate a positive return on investment. Based on the dataset provided on kaggle.com that includes basic match data, FIFA player statistics and bookkeeper data, we aim to implement various mining techniques to our datasets and built a model to predict the probability of each match outcome as win, draw, or defeat. 

## Usage of the EDA notebook

EDA process depends on a sqlite database. Database couldn't be uploaded to github since there is a file size limit. 
The dataset can be found at there: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EFquJdee4Ogi0R0vhQ1n9HuSziUHS2QB

The output of the preprocessed database can be found at data.csv file which is located in the main directory of this repo.
