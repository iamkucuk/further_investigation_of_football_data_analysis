# BIL 573 Term Project - Data Mining Project for BIL573 Course
# Further Investigatian of FootballData Analysis -F.I.F.A-

The goal of this project is to predict match outcomes of European football matches more accurately than bookkeepers, thereby beating the odds and to, in the end, generate a positive return on investment. Based on the dataset provided on kaggle.com that includes basic match data, FIFA player statistics and bookkeeper data, we aim to implement various mining techniques to our datasets and built a model to predict the probability of each match outcome as win, draw, or defeat.
